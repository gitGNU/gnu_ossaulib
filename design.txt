Assume an entry of each supported format can be mapped to an alist such that

1. it can be formulaically written out in the canonical contact format

2. it can be read back in from the canonical contact format, and will
produce an identical record in the source format

Thus far, every format has a distinct and completely non-overlapping
set of alist key names.  e.g. X-BBDB-..., X-GOOGLE-...

Now we define how format-specific key values are mapped to common key
values.

Any format-specific key values that can be exactly reconstructed from
common key values can then be discarded.
